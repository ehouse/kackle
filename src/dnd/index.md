My collection of D&D stories and rules I've created over years of playing 3.5
and Pathfinder. I've also included a second for some homebrew campaigns I'm
working on.

## D&D Stories

##### [Wrath of the Lich Witch: Part 1](/blog/wrath-of-the-lich-witch-part-1.html)  
Part one of a one off game I ran. Ended up killing most of the party and turned the spell caster into a Litch.

##### [Wrath of the Lich Witch: Part 2](/)  
Part 2 Coming Soon!

## House Rules

##### [D&D House Rules](/dnd/dnd-house-rules.html)  
House rules I use in games that I DM

## Homebrewed Adventures

##### [Casino of Terror](/dnd/casino-of-terror.html)  
One shot I created in an hour. Really rough but pretty fun.
