### Bad Movie Night

This game works best with a few people (3-5) but requires some forward planing
and requires a full bottle of liquor. Everyone involved sends the host
privately their movie choice to watch for the night. The movies can be ANY bad
movie BUT the they must get better the more you drink. The Spongebob movie is a
great movie to watch drunk, A Serbian Film is not. This isn't a fucked up movie
night and the host reserves the right to veto any movie choice.

##### The Rules:

1. The host picks a movie to watch from the list.
2. The movies ends when the bottle is empty.
3. If the movie is over proceed to step 1.
