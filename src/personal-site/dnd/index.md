<div class=article-list>

My collection of D&D stories and rules I've created over years of playing 3.5
and Pathfinder. Over the years I've also worked on a few homebrewed campaigns.
Most are tested through at least a few group plays but I make no promises on how
fair they are.

## House Rules

- #### [D&D House Rules](/dnd/dnd-house-rules.html)
The house rules I've created over many years of playing and DMing. They're
general enough to work for either 3.5 or Pathfinder. I've designed them to work
independently of each other so only following a subset of them is encouraged.

## D&D Stories

- #### [Wrath of the Lich Witch: Part 1](/blog/wrath-of-the-lich-witch-part-1.html)
Part one of a one off game I ran. Ended up killing most of the party and turned
the spell caster into a Litch.

- #### [Wrath of the Lich Witch: Part 2](/)
Part 2 Coming Soon!

## Homebrewed Adventures

- #### [Casino of Terror](/dnd/casino-of-terror.html)
One shot I created in an hour. Really rough but my party ended up loving it.
