summary: My first step into the BSD world.

As a long time Slackware user I have always been interested in how BSD style
operating systems. It's been two years and I still try to keep to KISS as much
as possible when writing software or maintaining systems. In preparation of
switching my personal server to FreeBSD I wanted to run my ThinkPad X230 with
FreeBSD so I could learn the ins and outs of the OS. I am using FreeBSD 9.1 as
it is most current but 9.2 release looks to be around the corner.

I agree with what the BSD projects are trying to accomplish and plan on writing
about it here.
