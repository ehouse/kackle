title: About
---

I am a student at RIT studying [ANSA](http://www.nsa.rit.edu/) and I just
finished cooping at Palantir. I'm a systems administrator and have a passion for
learning new things all around the technical fields. In the past I have worked
as a datacenter operator for RIT and as a sysadmin/dev for Research Computing.
I'm also a volunteer sysadmin for [CSH](http://csh.rit.edu/) where we run our
own services such as DNS, Mail and HTTP for other members of the organization.

I've gotten into OpenBSD recently and am working on a few small projects within
its ecosystem. It's mostly been porting software but I hope to eventually get
into writing code and fixing OS bugs. My current long running project is to
deploy a OpenSMTPD mail server for my personal use as well upgrade the one
running on CSH.

Outside of things people often consider work, I practice Martial Arts and have
earned a second degree black belt. I tend to tinker with my own hardware usually
to the point that something fails. I find I learn more fixing things. I've been
a training to be a volunteer dispatcher at Pittsford Volunteer ambulance with
the hopes of some day becoming an EMT.

I can be contacted at <ehouse@ehouse.io>.
