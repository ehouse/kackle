Title: Why Email Sucks

Summary: I hate to say it but email sucks. Here's why.

### Desktop Clients
Your options are the venerable Thunderbird, That's it. Everything else either
doesn't actually work, doesn't support imap properly, or is limited on what
platform it will run on.  Why a email client that is lightweight and follows the
spec is so hard is well beyond me. It's slow, the UI is terrible but at least it
works reliably. A hell of a lot more then I can say about the builtin OSX email
app. Well I guess there is also mutt. Terminal mail clients seem to break down when
multiple email accounts are brought into the picture.

### Web Clients
This is honestly the most optimistic part of this post. If you're hosting it
yourself you've got Roundcube and the up and coming Rainloop. Roundcube is
stable and works well. I've been unable to get the sieve filtering work but
other then that it's what I personally use. Rainloop has all of the pretty web
features you'd expect and sieve support works well.

### The Emails Themselves
They're massive! It takes 4k of email to send 400B of text. If you sign your
emails (You always should) that balloons up to 8k! Not to mention their is little
security built in to the system and what people do tack on barely helps. It's
incredible difficult to verify that the sender is who they actually say they
are and unless the sending server forbids it anyone can change thier headers
however they see fit. Email
