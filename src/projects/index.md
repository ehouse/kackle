A collection of projets I've worked on over the ages. I try and write as much as
I can about each one in the hopes of helping others past hurdles I may have come
upon.

## Wiki
I have a running wiki that I use to store information I constantly find myself
searching for on the internet. Writing it down gives me a easy place to find it
and helps with memory retention.
