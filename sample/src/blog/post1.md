NASA is not about the ‘Adventure of Human Space Exploration’…We won’t be doing
it just to get out there in space – we’ll be doing it because the things we
learn out there will be making life better for a lot of people who won’t be able
to go.

Where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination.

Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its
five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new
civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.

What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on
the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.
